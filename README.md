The objective of this repository is to familiarize myself with R.
Please check the files R01_2_1_InstallingR, R01_2_2_RStudio and R01_2_3_Packages for installing R and the required packages.
Here, I have tried out few visualizations using R for different datasets like IRIS, Motor car, US judge rating and Lynx.
To know about the implementation of statistics, please check the files R01_4_1_summary() and R01_4_2_describe()
